These techniques will be explained and applied in context of feature engineering a Quora dataset.\n\nI hope that by the end of this notebook, you'll gain familiarity with standard practices as well as recent methods used for NLP tasks. The ever-evolving field has a range of applications from [information retrieval](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) to [AI](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ind-watson/), and is well worth a [deeper](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/natural-language-understanding/index.html) [dive](https://www.ted.com/talks/deb_roy_the_birth_of_a_word).\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

Their mission, plainly stated: \"We want the Quora answer to be the definitive answer for everybody forever.\" In order to ensure the quality of these answers, Quora must protect the integrity of the questions. They accomplish this by adhering to a principle that each logically distinct question should reside on its own page. Unfortunately, the English language is a fickle thing, and intention can vary significantly with subtle shifts in syntactic structure.\n\nOur goal is to create features for syntactically similar, but semantically distinct pairs of strings. We'll be working with Quora's first [public dataset](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs).\n\n### Load data",

Although the task is loosely defined and depends heavily on the domain in question, it is a key process for optimizing model building. The goal is to find information which best describes the target to be predicted. \n\nIn our case, the target is logical distinction - will one answer suffice for each pair of questions? This target is described by the binary is_duplicate label in the dataset. We will need to process the Quora data to create features that capture the structure and semantics of each question. This will be accomplished by using natural language processing (NLP) methods on the strings. \n\n### 1.3 What is natural language processing?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-4\"></a>\nNLP is the field concerned with computational handling of natural language. Grammar is full of seemingly arbitrary exceptions, vocabulary is constantly transforming, and meaning hinges precariously on culture and context. It is no small feat for a machine to find patterns in this dynamic mess (which is somehow easily grasped by the human brain).\n\nWe will start with the simpler task of describing syntax. Skip to [section 3](link) for semantic processing techniques.\n\n## 2.0 Syntax<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-5\"></a>\n\nA **corpus** is the body of text that we are working with - in this case, the dataset of Quora questions. Our first task is to break the strings down into more manageable units. We will be using the Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK) library to apply the following methods.\n\n\n### 2.1 Basic string cleaning<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet-6\"></a>\n\n**Tokenization**<br/>\nConverting each string into a series of useful units (usually words).

The more related words are, the closer they should exist in vector space. Word embeddings come from the field of [distributional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics), which suggests that words are semantically related if they are frequently used in similar contexts (i.e. they are often surrounded by the same words).\n\nFor example, 'Canada' and 'Toronto' should exist closer together in the vector space than 'Canada' and 'Camara' (which would be closer in edit distance).\n\n**Word2Vec**<br/>\nThe mapping of words to vectors is in itself the result of a machine learning algorithm. Developed by Google in 2013, the Word2Vec algorithm is a neural network that takes a large corpus as training data, and produces vector co-ordinates for each word by the word embedding concept. \n\nWe will be using an pre-trained model from Google that was created from over 100 billion words from Google News. The model needs to be [downloaded](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) and handled using the [gensim library](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) for word vectors. The model is a dictionary that contains every word and its corresponding vector representation, which look like 300 dimensional co-ordinates stored in an array.\n\n**Comparing word vectors**<br/>\nTo compare word vectors, we can use cosine similarity. As the name suggests, this metric measures similarity by taking the cosine of the angle between vectors. The cosine function scales the similarity between 0 and 1, representing words from least to most semantically related.",

There are two ways to get a vector representation of a sentence: \n\n1. Train a model on ordered words (e.g. sentences or phrases). Since word order is included during training, the resulting vectors will preserve the relationships between words. I won't be training a new model in this notebook, as it is computationally heavy, but here are some [resources](https://rare-technologies.com/doc2vec-tutorial) for the curious.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Convert a sentence to a set of words, and get the corresponding set of vectors. Averaging the vector set (summing and dividing by total vector length) will give us a single vector that represents that particular set of words. This method can only give a 'bag of words' representation - i.e. word order is not captured.\n\n*Comment: I think that getting new embeddings specific to a corpus is the best-performing method in practice. For the purpose of illustrating NLP problem-solving, I will do my best with bag-of-words methods.*\n\nThe following function implements the second method to get the average embedded vector from a set of words.",

It measures the work required to transform one set of vectors into another. Instead of counting edit operations, we use distance between word vectors - how far one vector would have to move to occupy the same spot as the second.\n\nHow Word Mover's Distance is calculated:\n</a><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nllho/quora-nlp/master/images/wmd.PNG\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/>\n1. All the words in each set are paired off with each other\n2. Calculate the distance between each pair (instead of cosine similarity, Euclidean distance is used here)\n3. Sum the distances between pairs with minimum distances\n\nIf the two sets do not have the same number of words, the problem becomes an optimization of another measurement called **flow**.\n</a><br/><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nllho/quora-nlp/master/images/flow.PNG\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"/>\n\n1. The flow is equal to 1/(number of words in the set), so words from the smaller set have a larger flow<br/>\n(words on the bottom have a flow of 0.33, while words on the top have a flow of 0.25)\n2. Extra flow gets attributed to the next most similar words<br/>\n(see the arrows drawn from the bottom words to more than one word in the top row)\n3. The optimization problem identifies the pairs with minimum distances by solving for minimum flow.\n\nWe can use the WM distance method directly from gensim.",
