## POT Hands on Labs
Hands on Introduction to Apache Spark, NLP, ML and Operationalizing Models  for Data  Engineers, Data Scientist and Developers

### POT Summary
IBM is offering a no charge proof of technology for clients and practitioners on Apache Spark, Natural Language Processing, Watson Machine Learning and the Operationalizing of the Scoring Model.

This is a half day of education with hands on exercisesinstructed in person by Open Sourceexperts. The POT will provide a detail overview and the exercises will be performed on Jupyter notebooks with publiclyavailable datasets. Participants will use IBM’s fully managed free Cloud platform available for educational purposes.

### Prerequisite:
A basic knowledge of Coding (Preferred Python and/or Scala) and SQL.

### Agenda
Expect to spend a half day of lecture and hands on exercises attacking real-world data challenges using Apache Spark, NLP, ML and Models. In 4 hours, you will learn the essentials of why these solutions are important to your organization and data science process. This workshop will focus on data wrangling, machine learning, and operationalizing the model.
